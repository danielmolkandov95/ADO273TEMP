            <h4>Risk Disclosure</h4>
            <p>
                Trading futures and forex involves significant risk and may not be suitable for all investors. There is a possibility of losing all or more than the initial investment. It is important to use risk capital, which is money
                that can be lost without affecting one’s financial security or lifestyle. Only individuals with sufficient risk capital should consider trading. Past performance is not indicative of future results.
            </p>

            <h4>Testimonial Disclosure</h4>
            <p>
                The testimonials featured on this application from other vendors, software providers, or product users may not represent the experiences of all clients or customers, and they do not guarantee future performance or
                success.

            <h4>Hypothetical Performance Disclosure</h4>
            <p>
                Hypothetical performance results have inherent limitations, some of which are outlined below. No assurance is given that any account will or is likely to achieve similar profits or losses as shown in hypothetical
                performance results. There can be significant differences between hypothetical performance results and actual trading outcomes. Hypothetical results are typically prepared with the benefit of hindsight and do not involve
                financial risk. They cannot fully account for the impact of financial risk in actual trading. Factors such as the ability to withstand losses or adhere to a specific trading program can affect actual trading results.
                Additionally, there are numerous other market-related factors to consider.

            <h4>Subscriptions</h4>
            <p>
                Subscriptions are sold on this site, and are generally paid in advance to receive the service (“Subscription(s)”). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis (“Billing Cycle”). Billing cycles are set
                either on a monthly, quarterly or annual basis, depending on the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or Siteplan. cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through your
                online account management page or by contacting Siteplan. customer support team.
            </p>
            <p>
                A valid payment method, including credit card or PayPal, is required to process the payment for your Subscription. You shall provide Siteplan. with accurate and complete billing information including full name, address,
                state, zip code, telephone number, and a valid payment method information. By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize Siteplan. to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to
                any such payment instruments.
            </p>
            <p>Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, Siteplan. will inform you that the payment has not been received and if you do not complete the missing payment your user will be suspended.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h4>Free Trial</h4>
            <p>Siteplan. may, at its sole discretion, offer a Subscription with a free trial for a limited period of time (“Free Trial”).</p>
            <p>You may be required to enter your billing information in order to sign up for the Free Trial.</p>
            <p>
                If you do enter your billing information when signing up for the Free Trial, you will not be charged by Siteplan. until the Free Trial has expired. On the last day of the Free Trial period, unless you cancelled your
                Subscription, you will be automatically charged the applicable Subscription fees for the type of Subscription you have selected.
            </p>
            <p>At any time and without notice, Siteplan. reserves the right to (i) modify the terms and conditions of the Free Trial offer, or (ii) cancel such Free Trial offer.</p>

            <h4>Fee Changes</h4>
            <p>Siteplan., in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.</p>
            <p>Siteplan. will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective.</p>
            <p>Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.</p>
